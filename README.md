# Solutions to coding challenges

### Maximum Subarray problem
> Given an array A = {a1, a2, ..., an} of N elements, find the maximum possible sum of a :
* Contiguous Subarray
* Non-contiguous subarray

### Friend Circle
> Given a NxN matrix M, M[i][j] = Y iff person i and j are friends for all i,j. 
> Else M[i][j] = N. The friendships are transitive. In other words, if A is a friend of B and B is a friend of C, then A and C are also friends. The goal is to find the number of all the independent friend circles.
